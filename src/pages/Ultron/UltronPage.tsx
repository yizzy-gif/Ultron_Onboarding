   Ultron — sectioned feed (Live / Working / Done).
   One scrolling page whose content depends on the active section:
     · live    — cases that need attention (the entry feed)
     · working — cases Ultron is actively working (in-progress / monitoring)
     · done    — terminal cases (resolved / auto-resolved / unresolved / workflow)
   The Ultron identity card heads every section; the cases below are laid out as
   a vertical accordion (one card open at a time). DEMO ONLY — state lives in the
   shared store hook.
